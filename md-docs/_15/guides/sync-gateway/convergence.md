## Beta 2

- Mobile Convergence.
- In Sync Gateway 1.5 you have the ability to define multiple server URLs in the Sync Gateway configuration, and full support for SSL between Sync Gateway and Couchbase Server (ref [databases.foo\_db.server](../1.4/guides/sync-gateway/config-properties/index.html)).

## Mobile Convergence

### What is Mobile Convergence?

The core functionality provided by convergence is the ability for mobile and server applications to read from and write to the same bucket.

Mobile applications require additional metadata in order to manage security and replication. Until now, this information has always been stored in the document body. This required users to interact w/ mobile documents only through Sync Gateway, to avoid issues like:

- SDK writes failing to preserve or update mobile metadata
- SDK reads including (usually unwanted) mobile metadata

Convergence is an opt-in feature in Sync Gateway 1.5. Customers must explicitly enable convergence in the Sync Gateway config, using the [databases.foo_db.enabled\_shared\_bucket\_access](../1.4/guides/sync-gateway/config-properties/index.html) property. The feature was made opt-in primarily out of consideration for existing customers upgrading from Sync Gateway 1.4. It ensures that their existing configs will continue to work as-is, and supports upgrade without bringing down the entire Sync Gateway cluster.

### Extended Attributes

Previously, mobile metadata was stored along with the document body (as a `_sync` property). Updates made anywhere other than Sync Gateway would invalidate or overwrite that data, breaking mobile replication.  In Sync Gateway 1.5, the mobile metadata is moved out of the document body and into a system extended attribute, only accessible by Sync Gateway.  

### Import

In order for non-Sync Gateway updates to be available to mobile clients, they need to be imported by Sync Gateway.  The import process applies both security (by executing the Sync Function), as well as updating the document's sequence and revision history.


### Sync Function

When a non-Sync Gateway write is imported into Sync Gateway, that import is done as with admin credentials.  This means that any write security (`requireUser`, `requireRole`, `requireChannel`) in the Sync Function is bypassed during import.  For non-Sync Gateway writes, it's assumed that the application making those writes is applying the appropriate write security.  When executing the Sync Function for an import, oldDoc is empty.

Channel assignment and access grants performed by the Sync Function behave as usual during import.  

### Users

The method of [authorizing users](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/current/guides/sync-gateway/authorizing-users/index.html) in Sync Gateway 1.5 is unchanged. As with previous versions, the security rules are defined in the Sync Function. A user is defined with a **name** and **password** in Sync Gateway which Couchbase Lite clients use in replications. However, SDK operations to the same bucket cannot be user authenticated.

For example, let's consider a server application that is using Couchbase SDKs to support a web client. Users may want to access the same data on the web as they would on mobile devices. In this case, the server application must verify the user credentials sent from the web client against the Sync Gateway [/{db}/_session](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/current/references/sync-gateway/rest-api/index.html#!/session/post_db_session) endpoint first before allowing any read/write operation to the bucket.

### Metadata Purge Interval

Starting in 1.5, tombstones will be purged based on Couchbase Server's Metadata Purge Interval. The default Metadata Purge Interval is set to 3 days which can potentially result in tombstones being purged before all clients have had to chance to get notified of it. For that reason, the Metadata Purge Interval should be increased to the maximum amount of time users are expected to be offline between pull replications.

Ways to tune the Metadata Purge Interval:

- Bucket settings [on UI](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/settings/configure-compact-settings.html)
- Bucket endpoint [on the REST API](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.6/rest-api/rest-bucket-create.html)

## Sample App

The following tutorial demonstrates the extended attributes support introduced in Sync Gateway 1.5.

<div class="dp">
	<div class="tiles">
		<div class="column size-1of2">
			<div class="box">
				<div class="container">
					<a href="http://docs.couchbase.com/tutorials/travel-sample-mobile.html" taget="_blank">
						<p style="text-align: center;">Travel Sample Mobile</p>
					</a>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
<br/>
<br/>

## Getting Started

1. [Download the latest Developer Build](https://www.couchbase.com/downloads) of Couchbase Server 5.0.
2. [Download Sync Gateway](https://www.couchbase.com/downloads?family=Mobile&product=Couchbase%20Sync%20Gateway&edition=Enterprise%20Edition 
).
3. Create a new bucket in the Couchbase Server Admin Console.
4. Create a Couchbase Server user for Sync Gateway to use (Security/Add User in the Couchbase Server Admin Console), and grant that user the 'Bucket Full Access' role for your new bucket from step 3.
5. Start Sync Gateway with the following configuration file.

	```json
	{
		"databases": {
			"db": {
				"bucket": "my-bucket",
				"username": "my-user",
				"password": "my-password",
				"server": "http://localhost:8091",
				"enable_shared_bucket_access": true,
				"import_docs": "continuous"
			}
		}
	}
	```

6. On start-up, Sync Gateway will generate the mobile-specific metadata for all the pre-existing documents in the Couchbase Server bucket.  From then on, documents can be inserted on the Server directly (SDKs) or through the Sync Gateway REST API.

## Upgrading

To upgrade Sync Gateway to 1.5, you will need to stop all Sync Gateway instances. This means that mobile applications will **not** be able to push or pull data to the server during that time. Run the following steps to upgrade an existing Couchbase Mobile deployment.

1. Stop all Sync Gateway nodes.
2. Upgrade all Sync Gateway nodes to 1.5.
3. [Upgrade all Couchbase Server](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/install/upgrade-online.html) nodes to 5.0 or higher.
4. If you wish to use Sync Gateway 1.5 with the convergence feature, update the configuration file as shown above.
5. Start Sync Gateway instances. Note that starting Sync Gateway 1.5 instances with convergence enabled in the configuration file will trigger all existing documents to be re-processed. So it may take a while before Sync Gateway appears online. You may monitor the logs to track the progress of this operation.
6. Replications with clients (i.e Couchbase Lite) should now resume.

> **Note:** Enabling convergence on your existing deployment (i.e XATTRs) is **not** reversible. It is recommended to test the upgrade on a staging environment before upgrading the production environment.

## Migrating from Bucket Shadowing

As of Sync Gateway 1.5, the Bucket Shadowing feature is deprecated and no longer supported. The following steps outline a recommended method for migrating from Bucket Shadowing to the latest version with interoperability between Couchbase Server SDKs and Couchbase Mobile.

1. Follow the recommendations in the [Couchbase Server documentation](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/install/upgrade-online.html) to upgrade all instances to 5.0.
2. Update Couchbase Server SDK applications to read/write documents to the mobile bucket.
3. Make sure that all documents are present in the mobile bucket, the Sync Function may have rejected some documents based on the access control rules for example. If you are not using a Sync Function you can ignore this verification step.
4. Delete the shadow bucket from Couchbase Server.
5. Perform an upgrade of Sync Gateway instances as [detailed above](whatsnew.html#upgrading). This upgrade will incur some application downtime.
6. Monitor the Sync Gateway logs upon start-up.
7. Replications with mobile clients (i.e Couchbase Lite) should now resume.
